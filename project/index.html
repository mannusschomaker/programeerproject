        <p><strong>problem</strong>
         <br>
           In theaters Friday, “Straight Outta Compton” tells the story of the hip-hop group N.W.A., five young rappers from Compton, California, who revolutionized rap and its place in the mainstream music industry in the 1980s.
          <br>
          <br>
          The film, which counts original N.W.A. members Ice Cube and Dr. Dre among its producers, is also exceptional in mainstream Hollywood — it’s the only biopic about people of color in wide release this summer1 and one of only a couple of dozen made about people of color so far this decade.
          <br>
          <br>
          Unlike documentaries, which typically include raw footage and interviews, biopics are dramatizations, loosely based on the real-life events of actual people. Biopics offer an interpretation of lives deemed important (and profitable) by Hollywood, and they often try to make a statement about their subjects’ historical or cultural significance. So which figures filmmakers spotlight matters, as does whom they ignore (or can’t get the funding to feature).
          <br>
          <br>
          Women don’t fare much better in the genre than people of color — there is only one2 biopic about a woman in U.S. theaters this summer,3 and only about a quarter of all biopic subjects are women. That’s according to my analysis of IMDb data on biographical films released from 1915 through 2014.4
          <br>
          <br>
          Apparently, the people with important lives are white men. Since the early 20th century, more than 80 percent of biopicture subjects whose race or ethnicity I was able to determine have been white, and 77 percent of subjects have been men. The genre has seen vast improvement in the presence of women and people of color, but Hollywood biopics still tend to reproduce to a greater degree the stories of white men from all corners of society.</p>

      <div class="row">
          <div id="flip">Click to slide the panel down to get extented information on how the visualizations work and learn more about the story</div>
          <div class="infoText" id="panel">On the left side there is a visualization showing the amount of films autobiografical films produced with a collored person in the main role.
          <br> The other line represents the amount of autobiografical films produced with a non colllored main character. 
          <br> The amount of fims was measeured every 5 years. brush the line graph with your mouse to update the other visualizations.
          <br>
          <br> On the right side there is a visualization showing the average amount of dollars eared by producing films in the differnt catogories.
          <br> On button click the the bar graph will update to show you film earnings between diffenrent main character etnicities or difference between male and female main characters.
          <br>
          <br> Warning: all films without data have been given a standerd box office value of 1 millon 
          <br>
          <br> Node that when selecting data form before 1950 there is a big chance films with white main characters are the highest earners.
          <br> Selecting more or later data however will make you realize there is no finacial gain in making a films abount a white male.

              <br> On the left you see a sunburst chart, this
               graph tells you something about the distribution of demographic
                aspects of the main character in percentages.
              <br> feel free to check out a specific category
               by clicking on the circles.
              <br> clicking in the middle of the circle will
               get you back to the overview.
              <br> use the brush function in the left graph 
              above to see the distribution in a specific time zone. 
              <br> hover over the objects in the circle the 
              discover there quantity. 
              <br> Hover in the outer ring and you might even 
              find a movie to watch. 
              <br> 
              <br> Node that when selecting smaller time zones the
               closer you get to the present the the smaller the 
               percentage of white main characters becomes. 
              <br> although it smees we are heading in the right direction the
               percentage of other ethnicities than white is still to low.
              <br> seconde problem in this visualization is the
               small percentage of women as main characters witch 
               has not increase since the 1920
              <br> 
              <br> on the rigth side there is a network 
              visualization witch shows the amound of monney 
              eared in in every catogorie of films 
              <br> this visualization clearly states where the monney is eared.
              <br> the bigger the size of the dot the more the 
              catogorie eared on average.
              <br> in this way the visualization shows the importants 
              of the different catogories in time.
              <br> a catogorie migth strong in quantity but not in popualrity 
              <br> 
              <br> watch the finacial rise of the film industry bij selecting different time frames
              <br> node that in most time frames the white males do not come out on top.
              <br> this means no there is no excuse to make your main character somthing else than male and white.
